## Vector vs Arrays

- Vector is continuous arrays, index is start from 0.
- The address in arrays is continous.
- Vector is implemented by array. Vector is a container not array.
- Elements in array can not be deleted. They are only be replaced.
  
Input

```c++
void test_arr() {
    int array[2][3] = {
        {0, 1, 2},
        {3, 4, 5}
    };
    cout << &array[0][0] << " " << &array[0][1] << " " << &array[0][2] << endl;
    cout << &array[1][0] << " " << &array[1][1] << " " << &array[1][2] << endl;
}

int main() {
    test_arr();
}
```

output

```bash
0x7ffee4065820 0x7ffee4065824 0x7ffee4065828
0x7ffee406582c 0x7ffee4065830 0x7ffee4065834
```

the address is hexadecimal. From 0x7ffee4065820 to 0x7ffee4065824 is 4 bytes which an integer type.

## Problems

----

- two pointers
  - same direction
  - different direction
  - sliding window
  - binary search
